Before you can use my code you must install the
Turbo1_9.lib (AMOSPro_Turbo1_9.Lib for Pro).

First unpack the turbo19.lha to disk or H/disk.

For example, under CLI type:-

   Lha x TURBO19.LHA DISK:

NOTE: There is a copy of LHA in the "c" draw.

Once you have done this, there will be new files
in the now uncrunched DISK:Amos_Turbo draw.

The disclaimer_doc.asc in the Docs_Anglaises draw will
explain how to fully install Amos Turbo extension (PD ver).

*** To use the map editor ***
Type MAPEDITOR now.
