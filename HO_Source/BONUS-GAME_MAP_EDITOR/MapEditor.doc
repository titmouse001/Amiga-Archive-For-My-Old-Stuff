What's a Map.
-------------

Have you ever wondered how games support so many levels of graphics, it's not
unusual for games to have well over 200 screens.
If you were to save 60 screens with Dpaint, you would soon use a whole disk with
just those graphics alone.  This would Leave one big problem of fitting all that
graphics into memory.

To solve this problem we just hold a few key graphics in memory, this takes much
less space and the key graphics can be used again and again.
To keep things simple the key graphics are placed in a tile pattern, each
individual *tile can be given a index number using this method.

*tile = 16x16pixles

How do we Generate a scene from a map and key graphics?

Maps hold a sequence of tile patterns as values, when this is indexed with the
key graphics it produces a scene.  So each value held in the map represents
a separate key graphic.  Although for this to work each tile needs to be
carefully drawn, so it can be repeated with itself or another tile.

i.e.   A small 3x8 map.

   +-+-+-+     8=Sky. (repeated tiles used)
   |8|8|8|  7=Horizon. (repeated tiles used)
   +-+-+-+        6=House block, base part1.
   |8|8|8|  5=House block, base part2.
   +-+-+-+     4=House block, base part3.
   |7|7|7|     3=House block, roof part1.
   +-+-+-+     2=House block, roof part2.
   |1|2|3|     1=House block, roof part3.
   +-+-+-+
   |4|5|6|
   +-+-+-+
   
This map uses 8 graphic tiles to complete a whole screen of 24 tiles.   
      
      
Currently the map editor only handles a tile of 16 by 16 pixels in size.
You can still design a map for 32x32 tiles.  Just shrink your graphics for map 
designing, and use the default size in the game.
In fact it works better this way, giving a much larger map view.
 


INSTRUCTIONS:
=============


Command Line rules
------------------

When the Game Map Editor is first loaded, a "default.iff" is searched for.
If found the graphic tiles are automaticlly loaded from this file.

Or

   you can use a command line, such as:-

   CLI>Game_Map_Editor pic1.iff


Multitasking
------------

Left Amiga & M swaps between the map editor and the WB screen.


Moving around the Scene view:
------------------------------

Method¹ - Use the arrow keys to scroll.
Method² - By touching the border with the mouse pointer.


Title Bar:
----------

Title bar displays,

    Current drawing mode selected.
    Effects, Stencil on/off
        Random  on/off
        Cycle   on/off
    Current map location x,y.


The tool box has the following functions,

   1. Draw Freehand
   2. Line
   3. Fill
   4. Brush From Working Screen
   5. Filled Rectangle
   6. Pick New Tiles
   7. Zoom Out
   8. Options
   9. Undo
       10. Clr
      

The tool box has two states, giving the user a choice of layout.

   Mode¹: Rectangle Tool Box
      
      [==][o]   <--- Drag + close gadget
      +--+--+

   |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |8 |9 |10|     [==][o]
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

The shape of the tool box can be toggled by clicking on the close gadget located
at the top of the box¹ far right.

On startup Mode¹ is made default unless a 32 colour screen is found, in which
case mode² is made default.
Mode² is handy for a 32 colour or Ham screens, as it's not displayed as a sprite.
It has its own palette which is not effected by the main screen.

Dragging The Tool Box.
The tool box can also be moved buy holding the left mouse button down, then
dragging it to its new location.


 1. Draw Freehand

Lets you draw tiles with the current brush.
Hold the left mouse button to draw with brush¹, or the right mouse to
draw with brush².


 2. Line

Draws a straight line in any direction.
Hold the left mouse button to draw a line with brush¹, or the right mouse to
draw a line with brush².


 3. Fill
 
Use the fill tool to cover an enclosed area with a single tile type.
The type of tile will be taken from the top left of the brush.
Hold the left mouse button to fill with brush¹, or the right mouse to
fill with brush².


 4. Brush From Working Screen
 
Use the brush selector to quickly pick a block of tiles from the current working
screen. This allows the re-use of already laid down tiles, saving a vast amount
of time.

Its use is as follows:

   - Select pick brush, and move the cursor to the screen where it
     becomes a large cross-hair.
     
   - Drag diagonally to enclose the area you want to use as a brush.
   
Using the left mouse button to pick up a brush copies the selected area into 
buffer¹, the right mouse copies it into buffer².


 5. Rectangle Tool

Use the rectangle tool to draw a filled rectangle using any brush.

Its use is as follows:

   - Select rectangle tool, move the cursor to the screen where it
     becomes a large cross-hair.
     
   - Drag the cursor diagonally to form a rectangle.  When the rectangle
          is the size you want, release the mouse button.
          
Using the left mouse button draws a filled rectangle with buffer¹, and using
the right mouse button to draw a filled rectangle with buffer².


 6. Pick New Tiles.
 
Use the tool to pick a new brush with the right or left mouse button.

   - Select pick new tiles, and move the cursor to the screen where it
     becomes a large cross-hair.
     
   - Drag diagonally to enclose the area you want to use as a brush.
   
Using the left mouse button to pick up a brush, copies the selected area into 
buffer¹, the right mouse copies it into buffer².

  
 7. Zoom Out (scale 16:1)
 
Use the Zoom out tool to view the whole map area, the right-hand side of the
screen is used to display the scaled map.
The current x,y location can be changed by moving the cursor onto the scaled
map, and clicking with left mouse button.


 8. Options
 
Use the options tool to enter the options screen.
To be explained in detail later.


 9. Undo
 
Use the undo tool to revert the latest tiles drawn as long as there has been
no intervening mouse clicks.
The undo buffer only taking into account the current view, not the whole map area.
Holding any mouse button down while scrolling will only buffer the area you
started the scroll from.


10. Clr
       
Use the clr tool to clear the whole map area in one go using any brush.

A special case is made for this tool, undo will replace the complete map.

The type of tile will be taken from the top left of the brush.
Hold the left mouse button to fill with brush¹, or the right mouse to
fill with brush².


Options:
--------

Load

Loads a previously saved map from disk using the Turbo+ map format.
If any overlay maps (Hit/Arw) were saved at the same time, these will also
be loaded in for you.

Save

Saves the current map to disk, multiple formats are supported.

     - Amos Turbo+
     - Raw data with Width & height header.
     - Raw data, no header.

If the Hit Map/Arrow map option is ticked, these maps will also be saved with
".hit" & ".arw" added at the end of the name.


Overlay Maps:
-------------

Hit

The hit map simply allows you to mark tiles, selecting it as a hit tile.
For example, marking a piece of scenery your character can't pass through.

The save format is,
   File Size = Total number of Tiles.
   Data is saved as bytes, with no header.

The map file stores values as bytes, i.e. 0 to 255.
When saved, the size will be a 1/4 that of the main scene map.

The hit map is indexed alongside the scene graphics, that's why its called
a overlay map. 

To find which tile is marked,
   Read the tiles key graphic value.
   This value is then used to index the hit map.
   Resulting in a 1 for a hit, 0 for not marked.
   (not forgetting you can use up to 255 different values in the hit map)

But ahhh, I here you cry... Why not just use the map scene itself!
Well this method is much more flexible, also its very fast because only boolean
logic is used, ie. True 1/False 0, not a range of numbers.


Arrow Maps:
-----------

Anyone who has played my game High Octane may have wondered how I got the CPU cars
to drive around the track on their own.  You could even push them off the road and
they would find their way back on.  Nearly all the car games I've seen have fixed
CPU cars that don't budge a inch, leaving no way to knock them off the road.

To give directions on the main scene map, all that has to be done is simply lay
down arrow paths following the road.  Unlike the hit map you have to index the
directions by the main scene maps x,y locations.


The save format is,
   Size = Scene X map * Scene Y map.
   Data is saved as bytes, with no header.

Data storage info,
   Each byte holds, 1..72
   i.e.  360°/5°=72 turns.       1
                  |
   so      1° =  1 face up    |
      180° = 36 face down     55---+---19
       90° = 19 face Right    |
      270° = 55 face Left     |
                  36
                  
                     64  10
       45° = 10 face up right        \  /
      135° = 28 face down right       \/
      225° = 46 face down left        /\
      315° = 64 face up left         /  \
                     46  28
                     
Mid-angles are there if you ever need them.

To find a direction,
   Index the arrow map by x & y.
   The value read is the direction to travel in.
   Result is from 1 to 72.
   
i.e. You have two maps, the main scene map and the arrow map.  Both maps have the
same dimensions, so the arrow map can be indexed just like the main scene map.
Although the maps may be in different parts of the memory, they must be indexed 
the same way.  So they can be considered overlaid on top of each other for 
simplicity.
     

Note: The Amon extension for Amos supports fast angles between two points.
So in just one command you can make you CPU vehicle face the opposition.


Blocks
------

Blocks yet another name for Tiles!

Iff Load.

This option works in conjunction with the wipe/add toggle just below the load 
button.  It loads in a iff picture processing it into rows of 20 blocks.

Wipe.
When wipe is chosen the old graphics are wiped just before the new set is loaded 
and put in its place. This will not effect the map data, only the graphics.

Add.
When add is chosen, any new graphics are appended to the current tile graphic set.
To do this the iff image to be merged must have the same amount of colours as the 
current tile graphics.


Delete Range.

The delete range option allows you to remove any tiles that you don't need.

To delete a tile or range of tiles, place the cursor over a tile and click the left
mouse button.  This will mark the tile ready for deletion, once you exit the screen
all the marked tiles will be deleted.
Titles can be un-marked by using the right mouse button.

Once a tile is deleted, it's gone.  To bring it back re-load the tile set with load
iff.


Define Map:
-----------

To re-size the scene map, click on either X: or Y: text boxes.  Once a box has been
selected its contents are highlighted white, ready for a numerical keyboard input.

   X: Width of scene map
   Y: Height of scene map

Once the width has been entered presseing return will automatically highlight the 
height box ready for input.

Map Memory

The total amount of memory taken up by the map is displayed alongside the input
boxes as bytes.

Create map

Once you are happy with your new map size, click on the Create option with the
left mouse button.  


Draw Modes:
-----------

Stencil.

Creating a stencil allows you to lay tiles around a tile image without going on
it, as though it were protected.

The stencil effect will only operate with the freehand option, under single or
brush tiles.  Stencil has no effect on the other drawing modes, please take
this into account when using stencil.  It's also best to have stencil off when
not in use, as the stencil mode is slower.

When you have stencil active, an "S" appears in the title bar.
 

Random.

Uses the current brush size, and generates random tiles though all the selected
random range as you draw.  Re-sizing the brush will create a new random brush,
all selected tiles are ignored while random is on.  Only the brush size itself
is used.

The random effect will only operate with the freehand option, under single or
brush tiles.  Random has no effect on the other drawing modes, please take
this into account when using the random mode.  Also two or more random tiles
must be selected before this option can be active.

When you have random active, an "R" appears in the title bar.
 
  
Cycle.

Uses the current brush size, and cycles through all the tiles in the marked
cycle range as you draw.

The cycle effect will only operate with the freehand option, under single or
brush tiles.  Cycle has no effect on the other drawing modes, please take
this into account when using the cycle mode.  Also two or more random tiles
must be selected before this option can be active.

When you have cycle active, an "C" appears in the title bar.
 

Memory:
-------

Chip = Graphics memory.
Fast = Extra memory.     

Free Memory - The total available memory not used.

Max Block - The maximum amount of useful none fragmented memory.

Either chip or fast memory can be used for maps, the type is decided
automatically depending on the largest free block.


Grid:
-----

This will created a grid pattern over all the tiles, at gaps of 16 pixels.
In my view this option is not very useful, being that the pick up brush
system is very easy to use.  But some people may disagree, so its here.


Scroll Border:
--------------

Allows automatic scrolling to be turned off, or made more sensitive. 
Turning this option off leaves you with only the keyboard.  To scroll use
the arrow keys.


Quit:
-----

This option makes a cup of tea and cuts you a slice of cake.  


About:
------

Show registered users name and design information.


Save Config:
------------

This option will save your current map editor configuration inside draw "S:".
If no "S:" draw is found one will be created for you. This option will save 
from where you booted from i.e. if you boot from HD and then load the program 
from floppy it will save the configuration to HD. 

Configuration includes,

   - Grid status
   - Scroll border setting
   - Map X,Y Dimensions

On loading if no configuration is found, a default one will be used.
